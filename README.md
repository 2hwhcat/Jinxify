# Welcome to the Jinxify!
The language that based on **Python**!

*Jinxify was made by @thenlko in Discord!*

## How does it work?
First of all, you should know that you can still use input() and base python stuff like that. 

The file extension is `.jinfy` so be sure if you want to make Jinxify code change the filetype to `.jinfy` ;)

## How to execute it?
If you're in Visual Studio Code, type this command into the terminal
```bash
jinxify {filename}.jinfy
```
*Replace filename with your file name. Example: "jinxify test.jinfy"*

## Main Syntax


### Printing
Instead of using just `"print"`, you use `"print.log"`
```bash
// Example:
print.log("Hello World!")
```
`Output: Hello World!`

Instead of using `print.log`, you can use `print.warn`!

```bash
// Example:
print.warn("Warning")
```
`Output: WARNING: Warning`

There are also error prints! Lets use `print.error`!

```bash
// Example:
print.error("Error I guess?")
```

`Output: ERROR: Error I guess?`



### If statements
Let me explain how use it.

Instead of using `if True:` you use this

```bash
// Example:
if True is
 print.log
```

To use else or elif too!

Heres an example
```bash
a = input()
if a == 1 is
 print.log("First Place")
elif a == 2 is
 print.log("Second Place")
elif a == 3 is
 print.log("Thrid Place")
else is
 print.error("You lose :sob:")
```
Results:

| a Variable          |Output                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | First Place |
| 2 | Second Place |
| 3 | Thrid Place |
| 4 | You lose :s–æb:|
